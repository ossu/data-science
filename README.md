## About

This is a path for those of you who want to complete the Data Science undergraduate curriculum on your own time, **for free**, with courses from the **best universities** in the World.

In our curriculum, we give preference to MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) style courses because these courses were created with our style of learning in mind.

## Curricular Guideline

OSSU Data Science uses the report [Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Data Science](https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/EDU-DataScienceGuidelines.pdf) as our guide for course recommendation.

## How to use this guide

### Duration
It is possible to finish within about 2 years if you plan carefully and devote roughly 20 hours/week to your studies. Learners can use [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TEGSUQDFuWL3TYNjiM8G3esly-tKOcgHSDABt92mzdA/copy) to estimate their end date. Make a copy and input your start date and expected hours per week in the `Timeline` sheet. As you work through courses you can enter your actual course completion dates in the Curriculum Data sheet and get updated completion estimates.

### Order of the classes

Some courses can be taken in parallel, while others must be taken sequentially. All of the courses within a topic should be taken in the order listed in the curriculum. The graph below demonstrates how topics should be ordered.

![Topic Progression Graph](topic_progression_graph.jpg)

### Track your progress

1. Create an account in [Trello](https://trello.com/).
1. Copy [this](https://trello.com/b/JpvLwQfr/ossu-data-science) board to your personal account.
See how to copy a board [here](https://help.trello.com/article/802-copying-cards-lists-or-boards).

Now you just need to pass the cards to the `Doing` column or `Done` column as you progress in your study.

### Which programming languages should I use?

Python and R are heavily used in Data Science community and our courses teach you both. Remember, the important thing for each course is to internalize the core concepts and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.

### Content Policy

You must share only files that you are allowed. **Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct** that you sign in the beginning of your courses.

## Prerequisites

The Data Science curriculum assumes the student has taken [high school math](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-review-the-math-prerequisites) and [statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability).

## How to contribute
